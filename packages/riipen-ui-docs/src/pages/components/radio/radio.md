# Radios

<p class="description">Radios allow the user to select one option from a set.</p>

## Usage

Use radio buttons when the user needs to see all available options. If available options can
be collapsed, consider using a dropdown menu because it uses less space.

Radio buttons should have the most commonly used option selected by default.

RadioGroup is a helpful wrapper used to group Radio components that provides an easier API.
