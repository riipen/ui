# Vertical Divider

<p class="description">A vertical divider is a thin line that groups content</p>

Vertical dividers separate content vertically into clear groups.  
*Note: dividers should be wrapped in a flexbox container*

## Spacing

Divider has an automatic spacing applied to them based on the current theme. You can manipulate
this spacing by passing in a spacing factor size which makes the spacing between items larger or
smaller.
