# Paper

<p class="description">Paper wraps content within a contained background.</p>

Paper can contain a number of elements, including Typography to display messages.

## Elevation

The `elevation` prop adjusts the height of the box shadow displayed behind the paper.

## Outline

If you need an outlined surface, use the `variant` prop. Outlines can either be square or rounded, which are determined by the `rounded` prop.
