# Radios

<p class="description">Switches toggle the state of a single setting on or off.</p>

Switches are the preferred way to adjust settings on mobile. The option that the switch controls, as well as the state itâ€™s in, should be made clear from the corresponding inline label.

## Basic switch

Use radio buttons when the user needs to see all available options. If available options can
be collapsed, consider using a dropdown menu because it uses less space.

Radio buttons should have the most commonly used option selected by default.

RadioGroup is a helpful wrapper used to group Radio components that provides an easier API.
