# Button

<p class="description">Buttons allow users to take actions or make choices.</p>

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

- Forms
- Modals
- Toolbars

## Contained buttons

Contained buttons are high-emphasis, distinguished by their use of elevation and fill. They contain actions that are primary to the page's functionality.

## Text buttons

Text buttons are typically used for less-pronounced actions.

## Outlined buttons

Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are important, but aren’t the primary action in an app.

## Sizes

Fancy larger or smaller buttons? Use the `size` property.

## Icons

Sometimes you might want to have icons for certain button to enhance the UX of the application as we recognize logos more easily than plain text. For example, if you have a delete button you can label it with a trash icon.
